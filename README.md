# About Me


<!--**fcv10/fcv10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Github profile and a new iOS app!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL, R and Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to cozy games.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with business tools for analytics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sustainability and economics.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ask!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Rutgers alumna, dog mom, cat mom.

## GitHub & iOS App
- Want to look at data regarding plant based cereals and metal content (cadmium, lead, and arsenic).
- For the iOS app, I was thinking about making something for Sprout Valley farm planning. 
## SQL, R and Python
- I will be using AI LLM to assist me.

### I'll finish this later.
